# Bug Fix Example

A simple calculator with two bugs that need fixing.

## The Bugs

1. **Division by zero**: No check for division by zero
2. **Invalid operation**: Unknown operations should throw an error, not silently fail

## Task

Fix these bugs in `app.js` and verify they work correctly.

## Testing

```bash
node app.js
```

Expected output should handle division by zero gracefully and throw an error for unknown operations.
