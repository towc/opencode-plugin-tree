# Refactor Code Example

Refactor messy code into clean, readable code.

## Current Issues

- Poor variable names (f1, f2, r1, x, etc.)
- No proper formatting
- Unclear purpose
- Missing comments
- Should use modern ES6+ features

## Task

Refactor `messy.js` to be:
1. Readable with clear variable names
2. Well-formatted
3. Use modern JavaScript (const, arrow functions, etc.)
4. Add helpful comments
5. Maintain the same functionality

## Testing

```bash
node messy.js
```

Should output the same results before and after refactoring.
